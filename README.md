# Titanic Data Project

## Project Summary
We will predict passenger survival on the Titanic using basic demographic and travel information. This small project demonstrates a reproducible data pipeline—from raw data to cleaned data—so it can be adapted to real-world safety/risk questions.

## Stakeholder Persona
Primary stakeholder: a shipping-company safety officer who wants to identify higher-risk passenger groups to guide safety planning, evacuation procedures, and resource allocation.
